**Repository**: https://github.com/mr-fool/emg_drone_research

## Hardware Components

- **BioAmp EXG Pill** - 4-channel EMG acquisition module (using 2 channels)
- **Arduino Uno R4** - Signal processing and serial communication
- **Standard EMG electrodes** - Ag/AgCl surface electrodes
- **Python application** - Real-time visualization and research data logging

## Hardware Connection

### BioAmp EXG Pill to Arduino Connection
```
BioAmp EXG Pill    Arduino Uno R4
─────────────────  ──────────────
VCC             →  5V  (CORRECTED)
GND             →  GND
OUT1            →  A0 (Left/Right)
OUT2            →  A1 (Up/Down)
OUT3            →  (Not used)
OUT4            →  (Not used)
```

**Important**: Arduino Uno R4 operates at 5V logic level. Ensure BioAmp EXG Pill is compatible with 5V supply voltage.

## EMG Sensor Placement (Corrected Configuration)

**CRITICAL**: For proper 2-directional control, channels A0 and A1 must target **different muscle groups** to avoid signal crosstalk and enable independent movement control.

### Recommended Placement Option 1: Forearm + Upper Arm (Preferred)
```
Right Arm EMG Sensor Placement:
                                    
    Shoulder                        
        |                           
        |   [A1] - Upper Arm Bicep/Tricep (Up/Down Control)
        |    ●●   (Bicep contraction for UP movement)                     
    Upper Arm                       
        |    ●●   (Tricep contraction for DOWN movement)                     
        |

    ────┴────                       
     Wrist

        |                           
        |                           
        |                           
    Upper Arm                       
        |                           
        |

        |    ●●   (Back side of forearm, near elbow)                     
    Forearm                         
        |    ●●   (Palm side of forearm, near wrist)                     
        |   [A0] - Forearm Flexor (Left/Right Control)
        |                           
    ────┴────                       
     Wrist

      Hand   [GND] - Between thumb and index finger
          ●   (Reference electrode)
```

### Control Mapping (Updated)

#### Option 1: Forearm + Upper Arm
- **A0 (Left/Right)**: Forearm flexor muscles (palm side)
  - **Flex wrist DOWN** (toward palm) → Move crosshair RIGHT
  - **Relax** → Return to center
- **A1 (Up/Down)**: Upper arm bicep/tricep muscles
  - **Contract bicep** (flex elbow) → Move crosshair UP
  - **Contract tricep** (extend elbow) → Move crosshair DOWN
  - **Relax** → Return to center

#### Option 2: Separated Forearm Areas
- **A0 (Left/Right)**: Forearm flexor muscles (palm side, near wrist)
  - **Flex wrist DOWN** (toward palm) → Move crosshair RIGHT
  - **Relax** → Return to center
- **A1 (Up/Down)**: Forearm extensor muscles (back side, near elbow)
  - **Extend wrist UP** (push palm away) → Move crosshair UP
  - **Relax** → Return to center

### Electrode Placement Guidelines

1. **Muscle Group Separation**: Ensure A0 and A1 target completely different muscle groups
2. **Electrode Distance**: Maintain at least 5cm between A0 and A1 electrodes
3. **Ground Placement**: Position reference electrode on electrically neutral area
4. **Skin Preparation**: Clean with alcohol and ensure good electrode contact
5. **Cable Management**: Secure cables to prevent movement artifacts

### Troubleshooting Electrode Issues

**Problem**: Only getting movement in one direction
- **Cause**: Both electrodes placed on same muscle group
- **Solution**: Move A1 to upper arm or opposite side of forearm

**Problem**: Erratic or noisy signals
- **Cause**: Poor electrode contact or electrical interference
- **Solution**: Re-clean skin, check electrode adhesion, avoid electrical devices

**Problem**: No signal detected
- **Cause**: Loose connections or insufficient muscle contraction
- **Solution**: Check Arduino connections, increase contraction force during testing

### Signal Quality Issues
**Issue**: Low SNR or unstable baselines
**Root Cause**: Poor electrode contact or muscle group overlap
**Solution**: Follow electrode placement guidelines and skin preparation protocol
